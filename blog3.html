                            <p>Technology refers to the use of machines, materials, techniques, and sources of power to make work easier and more productive. While science is concerned with understanding how and why things happen, technology deals with making things happen.

                                Technology is emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, and less distinct internet and mobile phones</p>
                            <p>Technology is today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress. However, it is not only technology trends and top technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

                                Technology deals with different fields that is Civil, Electrical, Electronic, Information, Mechanical, Chemical, Material, Medical, and Environmental Etc.</p>
                          
                            <p>Today, our lives are far more convenient and easy, with everything we need at our fingertips. Though we may take technology for granted, we need to remember that what we have today is the culmination of hundreds of year’s scientific progress and breakthrough. Inventions such as the internet and mobile phones have changed the world forever. Development is closely related to technology. The stage of development the human being has arrived at could have been possible without the advancement in technology.  The radical change and advancement in technology, as we have observed today, is the result of modern technology. Technology has brought about efficiency and quality in the manufacturing sector. Technological advancement has reduced the risk involved in manufacturing enterprises. There has been tremendous improvement in the field of health the world over not only the average age of people has increased but the mortality rate has also declined considerably.</p>
                           
                                <p>This could be possible only because of technological advancement in the health sector. There is perhaps no field of human life which have not been affected by technology. Agriculture, industry, profession, health, education, art, political processes, recreation, religious activities, and daily life activities all are under the influence of technology. But it is important to keep in mind that technological advancement has affected human life both positively and negatively. Not only life has become easy and comfortable, but there are also indications of several threats to life and society in the future due to the use/misuse of modern technology..</p>
                              
                           
                            <p>Nature and extent of development the human society has experienced by now are heading towards a crisis in the future. The sustainability of development is in question today. This is happened only due to the irrational use of technology. Development-economic as well as social- takes place with the advancement of technology which itself is symptomatic of development, has brought about not only economic development but also radical changes in the social and cultural spheres of society. In the 21st century, the human lifespan has greatly increased due to advancements in medical technology and medicine. However, less than two hundred years ago having a fever or a cut can become life-threatening very quickly. Vaccines or treatments for many diseases did not exist as well. On the industrial front, progress was slow and time-consuming. Transportation was rather primitive and prohibitively expensive, ensuring that only the rich and famous could use it.</p>


                            <p>The covid epidemic offers an example. The broad goal, of course, is to end the disease. The highest-leverage approach is prevention. The ideal technology would be a VACCINE that gives lifetime immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies, and foundations fund vaccine research. But their work is lightly to take more than a decade, so in the meantime, we have to work with what we have in hand i.e. co-vaccine or covin shield – and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior.</p>

                            <p>We are living in a world driven by technology. The advancement of technology has played an important role in the development of human civilization. Technology provides innovative ways of doing work through various smart means. Electronic appliances, gadgets, faster modes of transport have added a comfort factor to our lives. It has helped in improving the productivity of an individual. Technology has brought a revolution in many operational fields. It has undoubtedly made a very important contribution to the progress that mankind has made over the years. Technology has made our day–to–day life. Everyone can afford a washing machine, refrigerator, computer, internet, etc. at the touch of the switch a man can witness any event that is happening in far of places. Technology has benefited in all fields like in communication, offices, education, medicine, manufacturing and production industry, etc.</p>
