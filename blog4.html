                            <p>Technology refers to the use of machines, materials, techniques, and sources of power to make work easier and more productive. While science is concerned with understanding how and why things happen, technology deals with making things happen.
                                Technology deals with different fields i.e. 

                                Civil

                            <p>In the 21st century, The human lifespan has greatly increased due to advancements in medical technology and medicine. However, Less than 200 years ago, having a fever or a cut can become life-threatening very quickly. Vaccines or treatments for many diseases did not exist as well. On the industrial front, progress was slow and time-consuming. Transportation was rather primitive and prohibitively expensive, ensuring that only the rich and famous could use it.

                                The covid epidemic offers an example. The broad goal, of course, is to end the disease. The highest-leverage approach is prevention. The ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives lifetime immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies, and foundations fund vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade, so in the meantime, we have to work with what we have in hand i.e. co-vaccine or covid shield â€“ and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior.
